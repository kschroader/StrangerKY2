        <h1>The Portal to Hell in Wilder, KY</h1>
        <p>Promoted in popular culture as "the most haunted night club in America", Mackey claims the site was originally used as a slaughterhouse in the early 19th century and later torn down for construction of a roadhouse that took on various names, such as The Brisbane, until he purchased it in 1978. Various urban legends and modern folklore claim that the site features a "gateway to hell" and is haunted by spirits including Pearl Bryan, whose corpse was found in a field 2.5 miles from the site in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. Other legends claim Bryan's murderers were Satanists who cursed the location and vowed to haunt everyone involved in prosecuting the case.[2] There is also a legend that claims a pregnant dancer named "Johanna" committed suicide with poison in the 1950s after her father murdered her lover Robert Randall, a singer at the club, by hanging him in the dressing room.</p>

        <h1>Waverly Hills Sanotorium</h1>
        <p>The Waverly Hills Sanatorium is a closed sanatorium located in southwestern Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky.

          It opened in 1910 as a two-story hospital to accommodate 40 to 50 tuberculosis patients. In the early 1900s, Jefferson County was ravaged by an outbreak of tuberculosis (the "White Plague") which prompted the construction of a new hospital. The hospital closed in 1961, due to the antibiotic drug streptomycin that lowered the need for such a hospital. </p>
